Hello, my name is Rafael Vital and I'm a Brazilian Indie Game Developer, currently available for work. 

I am from Salvador, Bahia a seaside city full of rich and colorful culture. I studied Digital Games at the [State University of Bahia (UNEB)](https://portal.uneb.br/) and am certified by the school [SAGA - School of Art, Game and Animation](https://saga.art.br/). 

I have been working with games for the past 5 years in a myriad of projects ranging from research and development projects inside the university, educational engineering solutions and finally my main passion games.

My main skill is programming, specially in the context of games (gameplay, ui, tools) but I also like to dabble with different techonologies such as web and game engine development, as well as other areas of games such as game design and 3D modelling.
